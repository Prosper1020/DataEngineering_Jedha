    "    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n",
    "    2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n",
    "       (amd64)\n",
    "    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n",
    "       executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n",
    "    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n",
    "       to your terminal.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:\n",
    "    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash\n",
